        <br />
        <li>
          Blackjack is a popular card game played at most casinos, where players
          try to beat the dealer/casino.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Cards are drawn from a deck and the goal is to have your hand be
          greater than the dealer's hand.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>If a hand of cards equals to 21, that is a blackjack.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If there are no blackjacks, the hand closest to it wins, so a hand of
          19 beats a hand of 17.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If a hand goes over 21, that player or dealer automatically loses.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          A player can stand on any hand, but the dealer must continue to draw
          more cards until the hand is 17 or over.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          When the dealer is at or over 17 they must stand and cannot draw
          anymore cards.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If a player's hand is equal to the dealer's hand that is a push or tie
          and no one wins.
        </li>
