Blackjack is a popular card game played at most casinos, where players try to beat the dealer/casino.

Cards are drawn from a deck and the goal is to have your hand be greater than the dealer's hand.

If a hand of cards equals to 21, that is a blackjack.

If there are no blackjacks, the hand closest to it wins, so a hand of 19 beats a hand of 17.

If a hand goes over 21, that player or dealer automatically loses.

A player can stand on any hand they would like, but the dealer must continue to draw more cards until the hand is 17 or over.

When the dealer is at or over 17 they must stand and cannot draw anymore cards.

If a player's hand is equal to the dealer's hand that is a push or tie and no one wins.

This game will be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
