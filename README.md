Blackjack is a popular card game played at most casinos, where players try to beat the dealer/casino.

Cards are drawn from a deck and the goal is to have your hand be greater than the dealer's hand. 

If a player's hand equals to 21, that is a blackjack.

If you do not have a blackjack hand, the player closest to it wins, so a hand of 19 beats a hand of 17, even though no one had a blackjack.

If a player's hand goes over 21, that player automatically loses.

A player can stand on any hand they would like, but the dealer must continue to draw more cards until the hand is over 17.

When the dealer is at or over 17 they must stand and cannot draw anymore cards.

If a player's hand is equal to the dealer's hand that is a push and no one wins.
